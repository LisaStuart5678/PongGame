# PongGame
My first interactive game built in Python

Here is the link to open the game of Pong that I coded in Python.  You must use Chrome and it opens up in CodeSkulptor.  Simply press the Play button in the upper left hand corner.  Use the up and down arrows to control the right paddle and the 'w' and 's' keys to control the left paddle.
